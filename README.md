# CFLookup

This project aims to help users to find out why their modpacks might be broken.

If you get an error in CurseForge saying `Missing dependency: project-<number>` or something like it.
Take that number and go to `https://cflookup.com/<number>`, and we'll try to find some info about it!

---

We've also expanded the use of CFLookup, so that we also provide embeds where ~~CurseForge currently doesn't show them~~.

You can make those embeds by either taking a CurseForge link, and just replace the domain with `cflookup.com`,
and it should work out of the box (as long as the project can be found through the API)
